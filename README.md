I was a dummy and created this github account without knowing how to use it then
I abandoned it for years. Now I am hoping to use it. I use this account when I 
want to put code or other things under my pseudonym purpleflame. I have another 
account here for code or things I want to put my name on.

Apparently I am making a markdown file but am not understanding its syntax and
proceeding to use it as a plain text file hence the odd formatting and look.
